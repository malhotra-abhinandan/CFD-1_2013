**Computational Fluid Dynamic codes** 

This  repository contains some starter Computational fluid dynamics codes (CFD) codes in C++. These codes are added to showcase some good functionalities like piping whereby the plotting is directly outputted to GNUplot. 

These codes are more in line with functional programming appraoch and will outut grid data which can then be plotted 
easily with any utility like matplotlib, matlab, gnuplot etc after the essential modiifications for the particular utility.

I had used the piping utility only in hyperbolic equations, just to see how those work back then so feel free to share the codes/use them and improve them. 

And if these are of any use to you, please add the star to the repository. I may add/improve this repository when i get the
chance with further commits as right now i am not working on this. 

Description of Codes:
